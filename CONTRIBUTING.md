## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel
free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ibm-aiu/spyre-webhookv-validator/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ibm-aiu/spyre-operator/issues).

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm-aiu/spyre-operator/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm-aiu/spyre-operator/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

### Development Guide

#### Prerequisite

- Go 1.24.13 or later (see `go.mod` for current version)
- Operator SDK 1.38
- Kubernetes cluster and its client (`kubectl`, `oc`, etc.) for test-purpose
- Openshift Local for running end to end tests on your local workstation (laptop)
- podman or docker cli tools
- pre-commit

#### Image build

```sh
make docker-build
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default docker image built is `docker.io/spyre-operator/dra-driver-spyre`.
> To push the image to remote registry, the remote registry must be set as follow:
>
>```sh
> REGISTRY=[your-remote-registry] make docker-build-push
>```

#### Pre-commit hook

Pre-commit hooks help maintain code quality by running automated checks before each commit. The hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and include:

- Code formatting (go-fmt, yamlfmt, shell-fmt)
- Linting (golangci-lint, codespell)
- Security checks (detect-secrets, detect-private-key)
- File validation (check-json, check-yaml, etc.)

##### Installation

Install pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

##### Manual execution

To run all hooks manually:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

##### Detect Secrets

The detect-secrets tool prevents secrets from being committed to the repository. It runs automatically as part of the pre-commit hook.

###### Install Detect Secrets CLI

To manually work with the `.secrets.baseline` file:

```sh
make detect-secrets-install
```

###### Scan for secrets

Create or update the `.secrets.baseline` file:

```sh
make secrets-scan
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command excludes `go.sum` files from scans.

##### Audit secrets

Review and classify detected secrets:

```sh
make secrets-audit
```

For each detected secret:
- Press `y` if it's an actual secret (then remove it from code and revoke credentials)
- Press `n` if it's a false positive

After addressing all secrets, manually update the `is_verified` field to `true` in `.secrets.baseline`.

##### Commit changes

After auditing, commit the updated `.secrets.baseline` file:

```sh
git add .secrets.baseline
git commit -m "chore: update secrets baseline"
```

Repeat the scan and audit process as needed when adding new code.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```
/*
(C) Copyright IBM Corp. 2025, 2026
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the Linux® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```
